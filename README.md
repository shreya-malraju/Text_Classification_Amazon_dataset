# Text_Classification_Amazon_dataset
Classifying Amazon review data using 7 different classifiers and analyze their performance

The demo video is as under- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRmL5AZJFiE 

Aim : The project is determined to analyse the performance of different algorithms by classifying the reviews into their rating class. We compare the algorithms using accuracy, and running time as metrics of performance.

We try to determine the rating based on the review text.
